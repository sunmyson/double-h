        <div>tokens of data, which required around 20 subtillian floating point operations, meaning in order to train this giant model, openly I likely used up to 25,800 GPUs that in total took them about 3 months to train, and each of these A100 GPUs consumes up to 400 watts of power, and once you stack 25,000 of them, the energy demand starts to add up really fast. Typically, when we have that many GPUs working at the same time, the challenge is how we can actually paralyze the training efficiently, so similar to H-</div>
        <div class="response">Response:</div>
        <div>The token model likely uses around 20 SBT (Subtillian) operations for data processing and requires extensive computational power. To train it on a large scale with state-of-the-art A100 GPUs, up to 25,800 such units may be needed over three months. Running at full capacity of about 400 watts per unit results in significant energy demandâ€”a major concern for training scalability and sustainability. Efficient parallelization becomes crucial under these circumstances, much like the H-system approach to manage extensive concurrent operations without compromising on speed or stability.</div>
